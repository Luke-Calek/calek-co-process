    <h3 id="journey-empathy-maps">Journey Mapping</h3>
      <p>The aim of a journey map is to capture steps in a users journey to complete a task, along with insights into each steps' positive and negative elements. Typicaly the horizontal axis are steps in a linear or branching journey, and the vertical access is for themes and analysis.</p>
      <p>Journey maps provide value by visually collecting and summarising a range of complex and numerious steps that can be easily shared with team members and stakeholders who need insights into a process but didn't not complete first-hand research.</p>
      <h5>Themes and Analysis</h5>
      <ul>
          <li><em>Actions</em> – what the user needs to do to move to the next step in the journey</li>
          <li><em>Question</em> – things the user needs answered either before they move to the next step, or to reassure them when moving to the next step</li>
          <li><em>Positive</em> – enjoyable things that improve the experience</li>
          <li><em>Negative</em> – Poin points, frustrations or annoyances that detract from the experience</li>
          <li><em>Opportunities</em> – areas to explore in the future that address the above problems identified.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="competitor-analysis">Competitor Analysis</h2>

        <p>What your analysis of competitors reveals might hints to how you should best launch your product service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If existing products in the market don’t solve user needs or are underdeveloped, your product or service can likely be launched as an MVP.</li>
            <li>If there are well developed products that meet many user needs, your product or service shouldn’t be launched as an MVP. To take hold in an established market you should launch a MAP - Minimum Awesome Product.</li>

      <p>When created and used correctly, user personas can be great guides to the expectations of users. When used incorrectly they can be distracting and misleading by containing information not important to creation of an interface or experience.</p>

          <li><em>Pain point and needs</em></li>
