      <p>Interviewing people who have a interest in the success of the project, to understand the current context, ambitions and challanges.

      <h5>Discover:</h5>
      <ul>
          <li><em>Business goals</em> – how will the design support business objectives?</li>
          <li><em>User needs</em> – how will the design help the users?</li>
          <li><em>Technical limitations</em> – what technical obstacles need to be overcome?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Jobs-to-be-Done is a framework for observing markets, customers, needs and competitors. It aims to uncover the core task the user wishes to achieve, one they would be willing to 'buy' from the product or service you are creating.</p>

    <h2 id="journey-empathy-maps">Journey Mapping</h2>
      <p>The aim of a journey map is to capture steps in a users journey to complete a task, along with insights into each steps' positive and negative elements. Typicaly the horizontal axis are steps in a linear or branching journey, and the vertical axis is for themes and analysis.</p>
      <p>Journey maps provide value by visually collecting and summarising a range of complex and numerious steps that can be easily shared with team members and stakeholders who need insights into a process but didn't not complete first-hand research.</p>
      <h5>Themes and Analysis</h5>
      <ul>
          <li><em>Actions</em> – what the user needs to do to move to the next step in the journey</li>
          <li><em>Question</em> – things the user needs answered either before they move to the next step, or to reassure them when moving to the next step</li>
          <li><em>Positive</em> – enjoyable things that improve the experience</li>
          <li><em>Negative</em> – Poin points, frustrations or annoyances that detract from the experience</li>
          <li><em>Opportunities</em> – areas to explore in the future that address the above problems identified.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="competitor-analysis">Competitor Analysis</h2>
      <p>Competitor analysis is best when it goes deeper than look and feel, to analysising if the competitor's product's features meet their user's needs and Jobs-to-be-Done.</p>
      <p>Using user needs, found via User Research or Journey Mapping, you can accurately review in-market competitors and see how they help customers to complete their task/s.</p>
      <details><summary>Competitor Status</summary>
        <p>What your analysis of competitors reveals might hints to how you should best launch your product service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If existing products in the market don’t solve user needs or are underdeveloped, your product or service can likely be launched as an MVP.</li>
            <li>If there are well developed products that meet many user needs, your product or service shouldn’t be launched as an MVP. To take hold in an established market you should launch a MAP - Minimum Awesome Product.</li>

      <p>When created and used correctly, user personas can be great guides to the expectations of users. When used incorrectly they can be distracting and misleading by containing information not important to creation of an interface or experience.</p>
