    <h2 id="why-define-success">Why Define Success?</h2>
    <blockquote>"Success can only be achieved, if success is defined"</blockquote>
    <p>Instead of just creating for the sake of creating, outline a clear goal for what you, your team or your company wishes to achive with UX. The below outline is a simple first step in aligning on a vision and mission for UX.</p>

    <h2 id="create-a-strategy">How to Create a Strategy</h2>
    <p>Writing a definition of the UX strategy for your workplace/organisation that includes all 4 of the elements below can help guide you to what success looks like for your team.</p>
    <p>Keep this short, 1-2 sentances maximum.</p>
    <h4>Four starting points...</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Beneficiaries - who</li>
      <li>Process - what</li>
      <li>Value - why</li>
      <li>Timing - when</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <blockquote><strong>Enterprise example:</strong><br>UX Strategy is a collaborative process at the inception of a new product, created to put our customers at the core of every decision we make to bring value to their retail business with a great user experience.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><strong>Agency example:</strong><br>UX Strategy is the collaborative process of creating world class user experience with our clients to create or enhance great products and services for their business that exceed their business goals and solves their users' needs.</blockquote>
    <blockquote><strong>Non-Profit example:</strong><br>UX Strategy is the activities we pursue to create new services for underprivileged people to higher their chances to have a better life, while our donors feel empowered to enable services through products that are tailored to their needs.</blockquote>
