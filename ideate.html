      <p>To create amazing experiences focus on the following three categories: Brilliant Basics, Iconic Moves & Extended Experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Brilliant Basics</strong> - do what everyone else does, but better.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Iconic Moves</strong> - create ideas that will become iconic and define the future for the segment.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Extended Expereince</strong> - extend beyond the core experience to leverage synergies of other experience / platforms.</p></li>

      <p>User Stories are the needs that a user has of a product or service, and that a product or service must satisfy for the user to get the right outcome for their task.</p>

    <h2 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h2>
      <p>By using creative ideation, you can explore many options which solve unmet user needs or stories. This is best done in a team of 2 or more people, but if resources are light, only review and discussion of ideas can be done in a group.</p>
      <p>Brainstorming can take different forms depending on the scale of solution you are looking for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are at the start of a project, concept cards could be useful to generate many top-level ideas quickly. See the resources sections below for a template.</li>
        <li>If you are focusing on a feature or page, maybe quick sketches of low-fi wireframes would help map solution options or alternatives.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ideation methods, like the ones listed on the untools.co website below, will help any stage of brainstorming and ideation, as they help you apporach the issues from different viewpoints and mental models.</p>

    <h2 id="user-flows">User Flows</h2>
      <p>A user flow visually maps a user journey step by step, documenting all actions, pages or elements a user could interactive with to complete a task. This mapping allows for discovery of previously unknown steps or edge cases and helps present complex journeys to stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Depending on the detail or complexity of your project, you could create a single large user flow to map all posibilities, or many smaller user flows to focus on individual journeys. Depending on which approach you take, you may also decide to focus on a detail level by creativing either <em>task flows</em> or <em>wire flows</em>.</p>
      <details><summary>Task Flows vs. Wire Flows</summary>
        <h4>Task flows</h4>
        <p>This variation captures the highest level user actions when completing a task. Depening the detail level task flows can include overall steps, page-by-page journey or individual tasks.</p>

        <h4>Wire flows</h4>
        <p>As the name suggests, this variation maps user flows on either low or high fidelity wireframes, allowing individual steps to be tied to elements such as buttons or ther elements.</p>

    <h2 id="information-architecture">Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>The structure of content in your project is called information architecture. This visual map, often called a sitemap, allows you to start to group, prioritize and label content based on user needs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A sitemap is the most common type of information architecture since it clearly defines the sections and pages of a website in a visual strucutre.</li>
        <li>A wireframe is also a type of information architecture, as a wireframe of a product page – which might contain the following: navigation, an introduction, product information, call to actions, teasers and footer – defines the content structure of a product template.</li>
      </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mental models</strong> - the grouping and sorting of content should be done from a user's point of view to best match their mental model. This can also apply to naming of menu items, eg. 'Contact' is very common by 'Reach out' is not.</li>
          <li><strong>Cognative load</strong> - when deciding the items and structure of your sitemap, keep in mind the rule of thumb that <em>'more than 7 choices can lead to information overload'</em> and choice paralysis. This can apply to top-level menu items, level-3 menu items or even content sections on a page.</li>
          <li><strong>Secondary content</strong> - a fully detailed sitemap also includes meta pages (such as Privacy Policy and error pages) not just main navigation items. Adding these to the sitemap ensures all content is documented and structured.</li>

    <h2 id="wireframing">Wireframing</h2>
      <blockquote>"The tradeoff between knowledge in the world and in the head"</blockquote>
      <p>Wireframes are a way of exploring the structure of a product or service, without investing large amounts of time to create it in full fidelity. They are an alignment tool, to communicate ideas, structure & content and to recieve feedback from stakeholder and users.</p>
      <p>There are two primary types of wireframes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low-fidelity</strong> - as the name implies, a low amount of effort, ushualy representing by large boxes indicating future concepts.</li>
        <li><strong>High-fidelity</strong> - detailed explorations on the inner workings and content of future concepts.</li>
      </ul>
