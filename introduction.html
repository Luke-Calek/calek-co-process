	<blockquote>"If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design"<br>â€“ Dr. Ralf Speth, CEO. Jaguar</blockquote>
	<p>Experience Design (XD), sometime also refered to as User Experience design (UX), is the practice of solving problems in people's lives with the creation of digital products and services. However, solving people's problems can be difficult, as we are usually designing for people with different needs and experiences than our own.</p>
	<p>The XD process typically starts with research, aligning the designers world-view with that of the customer, enabling us to make better design decisions, resulting in better experiences, products, and services that address user needs and achieve business goals.</p>

	<p>The XD skillset can range from research, strategy, concepting, design, pitching, to development. Individual designers skills can either be very broad, with general skills across all areas, or speicifc, with a focus on a single area or two. A sucsessful design team should contain a range of skills which adapt based on project needs.</p>
