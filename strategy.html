    <img src="images/1-strategy.png"></img>
    <p>UX Strategy is best described as creating the framework to find the right idea. As the frist diamond on this UX process, Strategy contains both divergant and convergant tasks.</p>

    <h3 id="define-the-customer">Define the Customer and <em>Job to be Done</em></h3>
    <p>Customers buy or use products and services to get a job done. Customers are always looking for the most convenient method to complete the job and in most cases are not loyal to the method.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For example a <em>job to be done</em> is ‘listening to music' - first people used records, then tapes, CDs, iPods and now streaming services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are two overacting types of customers: <mark>WIP</mark></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The job executors </strong><br>Example: I need to make a playlist and play music at a party</li>
        <li><strong>The job beneficiaries</strong><br>Example: I want to listen to music at a party</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3 id="uncover-customer-needs">Uncover Customer Needs</h3>
    <p><mark>WIP</mark></p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="discover-unmet-needs">Discover Unmet Needs</h3>
    <p>From the previous list of needs you now need to find which are unmet by the current market. Quantitative research will help reveal how satisfied customer are - an unmet need is when it is important to a customer but not satisfied with the solutions available. <mark>WIP</mark></p>

    <h2 id="converge-strategize">Converge: Strategize</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 id="find-segments-of-opportunity">Find Segments of Opportunity</h3>
    <p>By sorting the unmet needs by themes you can start to create segments of users you can address with a UX solution.</p>
    <blockquote><a href="workshops.html#user-needs">User Needs Workshop</a><br>
      Introduces and familiarises user needs to all stakeholders, allowing for grouping and prioritisation.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <h3 id="size-the-market-opportunity">Size the Market Opportunity</h3>
    <p>Quantify the number of people who execute the jobs you are supporting and what customers will pay to get the job done better.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="conduct-competitive-analysis">Conduct Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>Using all the unmet needs, you can now accurately compare how much better or worse products in-market are at helping customers to get the job done.</p>
    <h5>Competitor Status</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If there products in the market that don’t solve unmet user needs or are underdeveloped, your product / service can likely be launched as an MVP.</li>
        <li>If there are well developed products that meet many user needs, your product / service shouldn’t be launched as an MVP. To take hold in an established market you should launch a MAP - Minimum Awesome Product.</li>
    </ul>
